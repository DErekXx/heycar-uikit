import { Container } from 'storybook/blocks';
import Switch from '../';

When the Switch is unchecked (`checked=false`) the switch thumb is on the left side and the colour is `neutral-500`.
Hovering makes the cursor as `pointer` and changes the Switch colour to `neutral-600`.
Clicking on unchecked Switch also has a short pressed effect with colour `neutral-700`.

```tsx live
render(
  <Container>
    <Switch/>
  </Container>,
);
```
When the Switch is checked (`checked=true`) the switch thumb slides to the right side and the switch colour is `primary`.
Hovering makes the cursor as `pointer` but doesn't change the colour.

```tsx live
render(
  <Container>
    <Switch checked/>
  </Container>,
);
```

The component is currently available only in `primary` colour.
